# Neepy
The Non-Equilibrium Evolution PYthon based library (*Neepy*) is a programming tool designed to simulate the evolution of quantum systems out of equilibrium. This library presents a fast prototyping of the evolution of quantum systems based on commonly used evolution equations such as the von Neumann, the Lindblad, or the SEAQT equations of motion.
